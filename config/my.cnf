# This is an example MariaDB configuration file.

# The file is organized into groups.
# Each group is introduced by a name in brackets.

# Groups for the server (MariaDB daemon) are [mysqld] and [server].
# Groups for client programs are [client] and [mysql].
#
# The !includedir directive is often used to include other config files,
# such as those in /etc/mysql/conf.d/ or /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/.
